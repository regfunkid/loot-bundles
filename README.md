## Welcome to Loot Bundles!
Created by regfunkid (the fella who brought you *Reg's More Foods*), this datapack aims to add Loot Bags to Minecraft through the usage of Bundles. <br>
As of v0.1.0-alpha, the only available Loot Bundles to obtain are:
* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Vault Loot Bundles
* and Ominous Loot Bundles.

The main tiers of Loot Bundle can be obtained from killing specific mobs, and there are different chances of obtaining each type of bag. 

The only Bundle that must be
crafted to be obtained are Vault and Ominous Vaut Loot Bundles, which also require their respective Trial Keys to open.
<br>Simply have the correct Key in your inventory and the bag will open when used.

The datapack also comes with a few advancements, but more will be documented as the datapack leaves Alpha testing.
<br>That's where you come in. I would like you to download Loot Bundles from either Modrinth, Planet Minecraft, or CurseForge and tell me what you think!

### Installing on Vanilla
If you want to use this datapack in Vanilla, simply install it from the Modrinth and put the datapack zip folder in your world's datapack folder. 
<br>Put the resourcepack zip folder in your resourcepacks folder, and make sure you have it enabled before joining the world.
### Installing as a Mod
If you want to use the modded version, just put it in your mod loader's profile/launcher. It should work from the get-go!

Please tell me about any bugs or issues so I can fix them!
